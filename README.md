    -   Scan the QR code on your mobile device to launch the app on your device
    -   Press `i` to launch an ios simulator
    -   Press `a` to launch an android simulator
    -   Press `w` to launch in the web

### Backend

-   Open a terminal
-   Run `cd backend` to move into the backend directory
-   Run `npm run dev` to launch the backend
-   The backend is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
-   There's no need to access the backend from your browser, it just needs to be running so the frontend will work
