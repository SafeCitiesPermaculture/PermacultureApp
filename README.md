## Running the App

### Frontend

-   Open a terminal
-   Run `cd frontend` to move into the frontend directory
-   Run `npm start` to start expo
-   From here you have a few options:
    -   Scan the QR code on your mobile device to launch the app on your device
    -   Press `i` to launch an iOS simulator
    -   Press `a` to launch an Android simulator

### Backend

-   Open a terminal
-   Run `cd backend` to move into the backend directory
-   Run `npm run dev` to launch the backend
-   The backend is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
-   There's no need to access the backend from your browser, it just needs to be running so the frontend will work
